## My process

### Built with

- [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Leaflet

### What I learned

Reinforced my knowledge of vue and vue routing. Also reinforced knowledge of using APIs and Leaflet to display the country's location.

### Continued development

This project/challenge is complete. I will continue to use VueJS in the future for some smaller projects.

### Useful resources

- [Vue 3 Documentation](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) - VueJS website which has the documentation for the framework. Helpful for understanding how to use VueJS. I used Vue 3 though so the documentation will be a bit different from Vue 2.
- [Dark mode using CSS variables â€“ Vue JS](https://dev.to/lindaojo/dark-mode-using-css-variables-vue-js-37ilcom) - This is an amazing article which helped me implement dark mode into this site and let me toggle between both light and dark mode. It's good if using vanilla CSS. If you're using a CSS framework like TailwindCSS or ChakraUI then those already come with a way to implement dark mode.
